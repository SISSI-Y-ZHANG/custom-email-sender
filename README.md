This program only supports sending emails from gmail. To do so, the user needs to go to https://myaccount.google.com.apppasswords 
to turn on the 2-step verification and set up a 16-character password. Paste the password into the script after the variable email_password.

There is a website showing all the steps: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en

After that, the user will enter the email subject, and then format the email body in html. Some simple syntax are included here:
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial"> paragraph </p>
