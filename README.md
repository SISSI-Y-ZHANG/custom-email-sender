This program only supports sending emails from gmail. To do so, the user needs to go to https://myaccount.google.com.apppasswords to turn on the 2-step verification and set up a 16-character password. Paste the password into the script after the variable email_password.

There is a website showing all the steps: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en

After that, the user will enter the email subject, and then format the email body in html. Google for some simple syntax, such as font size, line break, and hyperlinks.

The user will then need to enter their recipients and corresponding messages. If they want to add attachment, they can also do so by providing the path inside the script.
